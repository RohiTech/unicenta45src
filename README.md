# Unicenta 4.5 Source

## I did not write any of this unless it was done past the commit this file was made (1/11/2018 at 6pm)

In order for the build to succeed, I had to kill OrderPop.java.

Build instructions:

1. Netbeans specific packages are used, so either use Netbeans or find a way to add the Netbeans packages to this project

2. Within Netbeans, add the Kotlin plugin

3. Do a Clean and Build

4. In the /target/ folder that is made by the build, either chmod +x start.sh and then do ./start.sh, or execute start.bat
